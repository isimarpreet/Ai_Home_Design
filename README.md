AI-Powered Home Design & Renovation Assistant

This project is an AI-powered home design assistant that suggests renovations based on uploaded images, estimates costs, and provides a 3D visualization of selected changes.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, Three.js

Backend: Spring Boot (Java), REST API

Database: SQLite

AI Model: TensorFlow Lite / Hugging Face

Version Control: Git & GitHub

How It Works

User uploads a room image (React UI).

Backend sends image to AI model for processing.

AI suggests multiple design options (e.g., change wall color, add sofa).

User selects multiple options from AI suggestions.

Backend calculates renovation cost based on selected designs.

User previews the room in 3D with all changes applied using Three.js.

User finalizes renovation, and backend saves the selection.
